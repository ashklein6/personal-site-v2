ChillCal is an anti-calendar application that focuses on free time rather than busy time. A connection-based app, users enter in times where they are available and their friends may request to “chill” during those times. Complete with a wintry, penguin theme, ChillCal is a clean, easy-to-follow web-based mobile application. Note: the chillcal-api project contains the server code.
