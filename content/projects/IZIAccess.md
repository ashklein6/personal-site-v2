This application for [Marnita's Table](https://www.marnitastable.org/) displays the reports (360s) generated from Intentional Social Interactions (IZI). It allows visitors and clients to search through and view the 360s. The application also features a managing suite that allows Employees and Admins to create, edit, and publish 360s and control user viewing permissions.
