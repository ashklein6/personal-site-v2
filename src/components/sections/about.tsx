      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Ashley, a full-stack software engineer based in Minneapolis, MN.</p>
      <p>I'm logically minded and creative at heart. I love to solve problems by designing
        and coding beautifully simple things. I thrive in a fast-paced environment and am
        passionately in the pursuit of knowledge and optimization.</p>
      <p>After graduating from the {' '}<a href='https://www.wisc.edu/'>University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison</a>,
      I worked as a mechanical engineer in nuclear pharmaceuticals. I enjoyed troubleshooting our
      project's software so much that I attended {' '}<a href='https://primeacademy.io/'>Prime Academy</a>
      {' '} to transition to software development. I got my start in software working on the mobile
      application for {' '}<a href='https://www.trypikup.com/'>Pikup</a>.</p>
      <p>For the full story, check out my{' '}<a href='/resume.pdf'>resume</a>.
